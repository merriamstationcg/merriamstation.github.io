<h2>Compost</h2>

<p>Sustainability is an important part of our mission at Merriam Station Community Garden. Composting plays a big role in those efforts. By composting our garden waste, we are creating nutrient-rich compost to use in our plots. MSCG has three compost stations, one in each phase. In addition, a team gathers coffee grounds from local coffee shops for use at the Garden—it’s a rich source of nitrogen.</p>
<p/>
<h2>Volunteer at MSCG</h2>
<p>Each member is required to volunteer two hours a month (12 hours a season from April-September) to Garden activities, beyond working in your own plot. Volunteer days are held from 9–12 on the third Saturday of each month, or you can volunteer on your own time. We have a number of ongoing opportunities to share your time and talents with our community. </p>
<p> You may report your volunteer hours below, or use the binder near the shed at the Garden.</p>
